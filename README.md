# Benevolent Sexism and the Gender Gap in Startup Evaluation

## Overview

This GitHub repository hosts the complete analyses for our study ["Benevolent Sexism and the Gender Gap in Startup Evaluation"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10422587231178865), published in Entrepreneurship: Theory and Practice in 2023. This research investigates how benevolent sexism, an ostensibly positive and benign form of sexism, influences the evaluation of startups. Contrary to expectations, our findings from three experimental studies reveal that benevolent sexism doesn't decrease the perceived viability of women-led startups. Instead, it surprisingly boosts the perceived viability of men-led startups while leaving that of women-led startups unchanged. This insight adds a new dimension to our understanding of gender inequity in entrepreneurship, highlighting that sexism isn't just overt negativity towards women but also includes patronizingly positive attitudes; and that inequity is not just about unfair barriers against women, it is also about unearned advantages for men while women receive the standard treatment.

The more evaluators endorse benevolent sexism, the more viable they perceive men-led startups, while benevolent sexism is unrelated to perceptions of viability of women-led startups*
