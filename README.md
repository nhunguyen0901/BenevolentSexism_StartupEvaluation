# Benevolent Sexism and the Gender Gap in Startup Evaluation

Hello and welcome to our project repository!

Here, I present the analyses for our research, "Benevolent Sexism and the Gender Gap in Startup Evaluation," published in [Entrepreneurship: Theory and Practice](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10422587231178865) and featured in [The Conversation Canada](https://theconversation.com/benevolent-sexism-in-startups-widens-the-gender-gap-by-advantaging-men-over-women-222486). Our study explores into how evaluators' benevolent sexism might influence their assessment of startups led by women compared to those led by men. To dissect this, we orchestrated three experimental studies where we randomly assigned particiapnts to evaluate startups led by either men or women, then we separately measured their levels of benevolent and hostile sexism.

## What we discovered

Instead of diminishing the evaluations of women-led startups, benevolent sexism actually seemed to inflate the appeal of startups led by men while leaving the assessment of women's ventures unchanged. This revelation opens up a new perspective on gender bias within the startup world, showing that sexism isn't solely about direct negativity towards women. It also encompasses seemingly positive attitudes portraying women as wonderful yet fragile creatures in need of protection. Moreover, inequity is not just about unfair barriers against women, it is also about unearned advantages for men while women receive the standard treatment.

The more evaluators endorse benevolent sexism, the more viable they perceive men-led startups, whereas benevolent sexism is unrelated to perceptions of women-led startups' viability*
